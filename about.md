My name is Allan. I like thinking about things. My favorite color is blue... yup.


Professionally I have worked on machine learning compilers, performance optimizations for latency sensitive ML applications, and done applied research on production models in autonomous vehicles.
I want to learn more about zero knowledge proofs, polyhedral optimization, and Greg Yang's tensor programs and related training dynamics research.
